  Notebook tutorials demonstrating advanced techniques for use of deep learning with TensorFlow 2.x and earth observation data.

  This is a "part 2" to https://developmentseed.org/tensorflow-eo-training/docs/index.html, with updates focused on the use of TensorFlow 2.x and the`tf.keras` API as well as updated content on state of the art deep learning algorithms and techniques.



**How to run the executable book code**:

A major advantage of executable books is that the reader may enjoy running the source codes himself, modifying them and playing around. No downloading, installation or configuration are required. Simply go to 

[https://developmentseed.org/tensorflow-eo-training-2/docs/index.html](https://developmentseed.org/tensorflow-eo-training-2/docs/index.html),
