However, most of the community that uses Huggingface publishes their models in Pytorch (there are over 100,000 Pytorch models). These models are published by the community and are unreviewed, meaning they may be more or less maintained, may not come with scripts and APIs that makes it easy to load, inspect, and adapt the model.\n",
